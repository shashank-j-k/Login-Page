#User Login Management System (C Console Application)
* Overview

The User Login Management System is a menu-driven C console application that simulates basic user account operations such as signup, login, password handling, account recovery, modification, and deletion.

The project uses file handling to persist user data and demonstrates strong fundamentals in C programming, including structures, pointers, string handling, and console-based input control.

This project was built as a learning and interview-preparation exercise to understand how real-world authentication workflows can be implemented at a low level in C.
